print(a)

ANSWER 2:-

     AND  OR  NOT
0 0   0   0    1 
1 1   1   1    0  
0 1   0   1    0

ANSWER 11:-
range(10) :- it will take 0 as default starting point and go upto 9.
range(0, 10):- there is two parameter inside thi bracket first one is telling about the starting point 
and second one is telling ending point but 1 value less than ending point.
range(0, 10, 1):- there are three parameter in this bracket first one is starting point from it start.
second one is till which point it will iterate 1 value less than end point and 
last one is telling ine one iteration how many gap it should take or step .

ANSWER 12 :-

for r in range(1,11):
     print(r)
